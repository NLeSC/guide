# Technology Overview

*Page maintainer: Patrick Bos* [@egpbos](https://github.com/egpbos)

These chapters are based on our experiences with using specific software technologies.

The main audience is RSEs familiar with basic computing and programming concepts.

The purpose of these chapters is for someone unfamiliar with the specific technology to get a quick overview of the most important concepts, practices and tools, without going into too much detail (we provide links to further reading material for more).
