# Guide

This is a guide to projects and software development at the Netherlands eScience Center. It both serves as a source of information for exactly how we work at the eScience Center, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

**Read The Turing Way instead**

Most of the generic content of this guide has been moved to
[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html).
Because The Turing Way is language agnostic, we have not yet been able to find
an appropriate place for the [language guides](best_practices/language_guides/languages_overview.md),
so we try to keep those up to date.
*Most of the other information is outdated, be careful when using it.*

**This Guide is a work in progress**
