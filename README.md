# Guide

This is a guide to software development at the Netherlands eScience Center.
It both serves as a source of information for how we work at the eScience
Center, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

**Read The Turing Way instead**

If you are looking for an overall picture of best practices, read
[The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/index.html) first.
We joined forces with that guide for most of our generic research software
engineering advice.
Because The Turing Way is programming language agnostic, this guide provides
addtional specific
[language guides](language_guides/languages_overview.md).
We also provide [technology guides](technology/technology_overview.md) on digital technologies we use often in our projects with research partners.
*Please be aware that most remaining [best practices](/best_practices/overview.md) content is unmaintained,
be careful when using it.*
We plan on removing that content ([#286](https://github.com/NLeSC/guide/issues/286)).
