# Guide

This is a guide to research software development at the Netherlands eScience Center.
It both serves as a source of information for how we work at the eScience
Center, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

To get started, check out the checklist of generic research software engineering advice
in the [best practices](best_practices/overview.md) chapter.
This chapter gives pointers to selected resources in
[The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/index.html) and the
[Research Software Quality Kit](http://everse.software/RSQKit/), two community-driven
research software guides that we collaborate with.

Because The Turing Way and RSQKit are programming language agnostic, we provide
in this guide additional specific
[language guides](language_guides/languages_overview.md).
We also provide [technology guides](technology/technology_overview.md) on digital technologies we use often in our projects with research partners.

If you would like to contribute to this book see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
