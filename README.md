# Guide

This is a guide to software development at the Netherlands eScience Center.
It both serves as a source of information for how we work at the eScience
Center, and as a basis for discussions and reaching consensus on this topic.

**Read The Turing Way instead**

If you are looking for an overall picture of best practices, read
[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) first.
We joined forces with that guide for most of our generic research software
engineering advice.
Because The Turing Way is language agnostic, this guide mostly provides
addtional specific
[language guides](best_practices/language_guides/languages_overview.md).
*Please be aware that most remaining language agnostic content is outdated,
be careful when using it.*
We plan on removing that content (#286).
