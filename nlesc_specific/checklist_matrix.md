# Checkmatrix for 'eStep friendly' projects.

This matrix shows what parts of the software sustainability checklist should be taken care of at (perhaps slightly before) what state of a project.

Though very generic in scope and context, this is an eScience Center specific list. This allows us to keep the number of "states" low.

## Explanation of project states

- [*Prototype phase*](checklist/checklist_prototype.md). The first step in most software development is trying out different things with no intention in keeping the intermediate results. Signs you could be in this phase:
  - You switch programming languages.
  - You throw away all of your code once in a while
  - You work on the code by yourself
  - You are waiting with showing other people your code until you "clean it up a bit first".
- [*Pre-release phase*](checklist/checklist_prerelease.md). Eventually you get software you intend to keep. Signs you could be in this phase:
  - You have multiple developers.
  - You have external contributors.
  - You are working up to a release.
  - Users ask you if the software is done yet.
- [*Maturity phase*](checklist/checklist_mature.md): Software that has reached maturity, has a clear function and scope, and is used. Signs you could be in this phase:
  - The software has a release.
  - The software has users: people actually using your software/code
  - You have external contributor
  - The software is actively used and contributed to by so many people that it becomes a community project rather than an eScience Center project.

These states happen in order and are exclusive.
