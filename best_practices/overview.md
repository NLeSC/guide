# Software Development

In this chapter we give an overview of the best practices for software development at the Netherlands eScience Center, including a rationale.

## Know your tools

In addition to the advice on the best practices in these chapters, knowing the
tools that are available for software development can really help you getting
things done faster.

### Learn how to use the command line efficiently

Read the chapter on using [Bash](/language_guides/bash.md).

### Use an editor that helps you develop

Commonly used editors and their ecosystem of plugins can really help you write
better code faster.
Note that for each of the editors and environments listed below, it is important
to configure them such that they support the programming languages that you are
developing in.

Below is a list of editors that support many programming languages.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - modern IDE
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - modern IDE
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) - a bit older but still nice

Text editors:
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - modern text editor
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) - classic text editor
- [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - classic text editor
