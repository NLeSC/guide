# Software checklist

Here we provide a short checklist for software projects, the rest of this chapter elaborates on the various point in this list.


The __bare minimum__ that every software project should do, from the start, is:
* Pick & include an [open source license](No link yet)
* Use [version control](version_control.html) 
* Use a publicly accessible version control repository 
* Add a [readme describing the project](documentation.html#readme) 

We recommend that you also do the following (from the start of the project):
* Use [code quality tools](code_quality.html)
* [Testing](testing.html)
* Use [standards](standards.html)

Additional steps depend on the goal of the software (zero or more can apply):
* [I'm publishing a paper](#im-publishing-a-paper)
* [I'm expecting users](#im-expecting-users)
* [I'm expecting contributors](#im-expecting-contributors)

## I'm publishing a paper

* Release your software 
* Add a [DOI to your release](../publishing_results.html#making-software-citable) 
* Cite DOI in paper 
* Add a CITATION file 

## I'm expecting users

* Provide [user documentation](documentation.html)
* Easy installation
* Provide issue tracker

## I'm expecting contributors

* Provide [development documentation](documentation.html#source-code-documentation)
* Provide a means of communication
* Add a code of conduct
* Contribution guideline
