# Teamwork

If done well, working in a team can be more fun, more productive, and more effective.
There are both benefits and downsides of working in teams, 
and the key is to work together in such a way that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

You can learn more about teamwork in [The Turing Way](https://deploy-preview-2239--the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/new-community/new-community-teamwork.html#cl-new-community-teamwork).

## How we do teams at the Netherlands eScience Center

*Schematic overview of how teams operate at the Netherlands eScience Center*

There is not one fixed way of how teams operate at the center.
Even the definition of what a team is is flexible. 
On one side there are formally defined teams in which engineers mostly work within the team and focus on a few projects.
On the other extreme a pair of two engineers that occasianally review each other's code can also already be called a team.
Checkout this [whitepaper](https://collegeville.github.io/CW21/WorkshopResources/WhitePapers/structured-unstructured-teams.pdf)
about the range of teams we have at the center.

Here are a few guidelines on working in teams (the above figure could help visualizing)
* Working in a team is optional.
* Teams are self-organizing, there is no boss outside of the team that tells the team what to do.
* Teams should consider diversity in terms of technical skills, seniority and perspectives (for example sex, age, ethnic group).
* Teams are responsible for entire projects from start to finish.
* Teams are responsible for their own planning.
* Most engineers in the team are Lead Engineer on at least one project.
* Usually the team members commit most of the time to projects within the team.
* Engineers that are not part of the team can act as 'consultant' for the team. A consultant can for example bring in some expertise that the team does not have.
* It is useful to have someone in the team who has the role of team coach.
