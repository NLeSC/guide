#Publishing Scientific Results

## Ready-to-go demos
For many projects, we will prepare attractive demos. We want to be able to show a working demo at any moment in time. Therefore, we want to have special branches in git that contain fully stand-alone demos, including a slide deck, that can just be checked out and used directly.

## Handling datasets and results
Assuming you have only the software in a (private) git repo, you might want to also add and share with others the data and results related to that software:
* Add also the data and figures using git lfs ([Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)). 
* If not, make the repo public. 

## Citing datasets, software and results
* Make a [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) account and link it with your github account as explained on [guides.github.com/activities/citable-code](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
* Make a release in github.
* Zenodo automatically tracks the release and generates a unique DOI.
* Use the DOI for citing your software/data/results.
* A badge can be added to the README reflecting the DOI of the latest release
