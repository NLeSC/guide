# Rust

Rust is a modern, programming language designed to provide both high
performance and robust memory safety. Developed by Mozilla and first released in
2015, Rust has rapidly gained popularity for its ability to prevent common
programming errors at compile time. It is commonly categorized as a systems
programming language but over the last few years it's ecosystem has grown
considerably and Rust is being adopted as a general programming language.

It is however a **low-level** language, which gives you direct control over
hardware and memory (like [C/C++](./ccpp)). For comparison, [Python](./python)
is a **high-level** language that prioritizes readability by abstracting these
details - in Python you don't ever need to think about cleaning variables from memory,
but in a **low-level** language you need to manage it yourself. Because Rust
runs "closer to the metal", it achieves blazing-fast performance - similar to [C/C++](./ccpp).

Here are some of Rust's key characteristics:

- **Type Safety**: Strict compile-time checks ensure variables, data types,
  and operations are error-free, so there will be no surprises at runtime.

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level syntax (e.g., iterators, traits) compiles
  to machine code as efficiently as hand-written low-level code.

- **Fearless Concurrency**: Built-in rules prevent data races, letting you
  write safe, parallel code without runtime crashes.

- **Expressive Enums & Pattern Matching**: Enums can hold data, and match
  ensures all cases are handledâ€”no forgotten edge cases.

- **Traits for Polymorphism**: Define shared behavior across types without
  runtime overhead.

- **Rich Ecosystem**: Tools like [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
  (package manager), [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/usage.html)
  (linting), and [crates.io](https://crates.io) (libraries) streamline development.

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's unique ownership system guarantees memory safety at compile
  time, eliminating crashes from null pointers, dangling references, or leaks.

```rust
// Ownership in action: the compiler tracks who "owns" data.
fn main() {
    // Lets declare a string, here `s` owns it
    let s = String::from("hello");

    // Borrow `s` as a read-only reference (no ownership transference)
    let len = calculate_length(&s);

    // `s` still owns the data and we can use it
    println!("'{}' has length {}", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

Rust is increasingly adopted in **research software** for its unique blend of
speed, safety, and modern tooling. It powers everything from
high-throughput DNA sequencing pipelines to climate simulations, where even
minor memory errors could invalidate results. By eliminating entire classes
of bugs (e.g., null pointers, race conditions, type mismatches), Rust lets
researchers focus on science, not on debugging.

## Getting started

To get started you will first need to install Rust, this can be done via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs)
which is a command line tool for managing Rust versions and tools.

On Linux/MacOs:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

On Windows, [see the instructions here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows).

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager and is installed by `rustup`.
You can use it to create a project:

```bash
cargo new rust_project
```

This will create the project folder structure, add a `Cargo.toml` and a `src/main.rs`
which contains a placeholder "Hello world", so you can already build this
`rust_project`

```bash
cd rust_project
cargo build --release # using --release will build the optimized binary
./target/release/rust_project # execute the binary
```

## Learning

It's unique approach to memory management (ownership, borrowing and lifetimes) and
the strict compiler can feel daunting at fist - especially if you are accustomed
to high-level languages like [python](./python.md) or [javascript](./javascript.md).
You **will** wrestle with the borrow checker and some concepts may take time to be
internalized.

> Keep in mind that in the long run all the effort pays off. The code produced
> will have _fewer bugs_ (thanks to the opinionated compiler), you will learn
> _transferable skills_ that will make you a better programmer in other
> languages. The general mindset should be **start small and embrace the compiler**.

To learn it, you only need:

- [The Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch00-00-introduction.html): This
  is the official book and it is very well written and easy to follow. It contains
  all the information you need to gain a deep understanding of Rust. It contains
  a fully guided tutorial on how to write a Guessing game as your first project.
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/): This contains
  smaller examples of how to use the language, and it is a good complement to
  the book or when you need to quickly look up how to do something.
- [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool): Fully interactive exercises
  that will help you get used to the syntax and the concepts of the language -
  it is paired with the book, so you should be doing the exercises as you go
  through the book.
