# Version control

To keep our code transparent and findable the preferred code hosting platform is GitHub and version management or source control management (SCM) is git. The repo preferable should be public from the start.

## GitHub

Netherlands eScience center uses GitHub [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for version control.

By default an eScience Research Engineer is expected to create a new [Github organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/) for each  project and create repositories in there.
However a new repository should be made in the [Netherlands eScience center Github organization (https://github.com/NLeSC)](https://github.com/NLeSC) when repository is used in multiple projects.

### Policy

* No repositories which Netherlands eScience center is paying for should be in personal accounts, they SHOULD always be in either in the [Netherlands eScience center Github organization](https://github.com/NLeSC) or in a project based GitHub organization
* GitHub supports [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/). This SHOULD be enabled for your account
* Project based GitHub organizations
  * MUST have at least two owners that are Netherlands eScience center employees
  * MUST be [registered](https://github.com/NLeSC/nlesc.github.io#adding-an-github-organization) at [https://nlesc.github.io/](https://nlesc.github.io/), to keep track of all the project organizations
  * Private repositories can be created. Free when [GitHub's education discount](https://education.github.com/) is requested. **NOTE**: The [Netherlands eScience Center IP policy](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/NLeSC_IP_policy_vJan2015.pdf) applies to all software we contribute to, unless specific exceptions have been agreed at the project start beforehand. The repository SHOULD become open source at some point
* [Netherlands eScience center Github organization (https://github.com/NLeSC)](https://github.com/NLeSC)
  * Only Netherlands eScience center employees are members
  * All members have permission to create new repositories
  * [Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) SHOULD be used to grant access to non-members
  * A limited number of slots for private repositories is available, but using them is discouraged

## Version control from the beginning of the project

It is highly recommended to start using version control on day one of the project.

## Use git as version control system (VCS)

Other VCSes can be used if the project does not start in the eScience Center and does not use git, or when the prevailing VCS in the particular community is not git. Even then, changing VCS should be considered (especially if Subversion or another centralised system is used).

## Choose one branching model

A branching model describes how the project deals with different versions of the codebase, like releases and various development versions, and how to accept code contributions.
Make the choice explicit in the contribution guidelines, and link to documentation on how to get started with it.
Our default choice is [GitHub flow branching model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

GitHub flow is a very simple and sane branching model. It supports collaboration and is based on pull requests, therefore relies
heavily on GitHub. The [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) book describes in detail the workflow of collaboration on the project
with use of git branches,
forks and GitHub in [Contributing to a Project chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project).
Other more complicated models could be used if necessary, but we should strive for simplicity and uniformity
within the eScience Center since that will enhance collaboration between the engineers. Learning a new branching model should not stand in the way
of contributions.
You can learn more about those other models from [atlasian page](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).

## Meaningful commit messages

Commit messages are the way for other developers to understand changes in the codebase. In case of using GitHub flow model commit
messages can be very short but pull request comment should explain all the changes. It is very important is to explain the why
behind implementation choices. To learn more about writing good commit messages read
[tpopeâ€™s guide](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
and [this post](http://who-t.blogspot.nl/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)

GitHub has some interesting features that allow you to [close issues directly from commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

## Code snippets library

Sometimes, we develop small snippets of code that can be directly reused in other projects, but that are too small to put in a library. We store these code snippets in git, in [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/).
